# Warren-Roof-Truss
To analyze and design Warren Roof Truss using SAP2000 software and IS:800 2007
The objective of this project is to perform both the structural analysis and design of a 
steel Warren truss roof system for an industrial shed located in Silchar, ensuring 
safety, stability, and compliance with relevant Indian Standards. The truss is to be 
analysed using SAP2000 software, and the critical members will be designed based on 
internal forces obtained from the analysis. 
Key project parameters include: 
• Location: Silchar 
• Design life: 50 years 
• Terrain category: Category 1 
• Shed dimensions: 60 m × 20 m  
• Column spacing: 15 m (centre to centre) 
• Ceiling height: 10 m (from shop floor to truss bottom) 
• Truss type: Warren Truss 
• Rise of truss: 4 m 
• Truss spacing: Not more than 5 m 
• Material: Structural steel with yield strength fy = 250 MPa 
The primary objectives of the analysis are: 
• To model the Warren truss structure accurately in SAP2000 based on the given 
geometry and support conditions. 
• To apply relevant loads and combinations in accordance with IS codes, 
particularly: 
o 1.5 (Dead Load + Live Load) 
o 1.5 (Dead Load + Wind Load) 
o 1.2 (Dead Load + Live Load + Wind Load) 
• To determine internal axial forces, support reactions, and member force 
distribution under different loading scenarios. 
• To perform the final design of critical members in accordance with IS 
800:2007, using the results from the analysis.
